Participants will create Learner Profiles that can be used to assess each student’s progress and will develop strategies for planning for the development of each learner.

Participants will This use formative assessment to build on each student’s learning profile and chart their progress in a manner that provides meaningful feedback to the student and his/her family and serves as a guide to principals as they seek to support continuous school improvement. They will consider what information is needed to help them teach to the needs of each student in their class and will consider how to collect and share data will those who support the learners (teaching colleagues and parents/families).  The OECS Grade 2 Assessments will be introduced so that participants can identify how the results might be used to support their teaching of individual learners who have completed them.<br><br>

As assessment questions are not always questions, they are referred to as “items”, this session will explore the development of items that result in fair and equitable assessment. Participants will explore how Tables of Specifications are developed to ensure that assessment is tied to curriculum outcomes and will develop Tables of Specifications for the OECS Grade 2 Assessments. The concept of performance tasks and how they have been used internationally will be discussed.  An emphasis will be placed on the rationale for their inclusion in national assessments.  The concept of portfolios to assess writing progress and how they have been used internationally will be discussed.  An emphasis will be placed on the rationale for their inclusion in national assessments.

They consider how scoring guides are developed and used to score Language Arts and Mathematics Assessments in a manner that elicits the most information about student learning.  They will then, with the guidance of the facilitator, develop scoring guides for the OECS Grade 2 Assessments that are designed to elicit the most information about student learning.
